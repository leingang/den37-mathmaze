# March 21 meeting

## Open scratch

Go to [scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) and log in.

## First tutorial

Work on the [Under the Sea](http://scratch.ie/sites/all/themes/scratch_theme/resources/PrimaryLessonPlans2.0/Module1Version2.0.pdf) lesson.

## Group Options

### Math Maze team

We need to figure out

* who will design what elements (hero, critter, boss, mazes, cut scenes)
* how to make the critters move better
* how to make the boss battle work

### Play and remix the [Fishing](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/151328910/) game.

Can you add an effect like Scratchy saying "Chomp!" or a sound?

Can you add other fish?  You can use the backpack to transfer scripts from one sprite to another.

Can you make it easier or harder?

### Free exploration of animations in scratch
